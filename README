Bumblebee is an App that takes a user's input:  either text or spoken audio and converts it into an audio file "mp3" created by calling multiple API's and pulling multiple sources of matching audio in order to mimic the way the character Bumblebee from the Transformers franchise uses his AM/FM Radio to communicate with people.

This application is still in developement.

This is my very first application!  Let's Go!
